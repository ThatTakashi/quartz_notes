## Story
Faced with external threats from neighbouring kingdoms and empires, several independent city-states form an alliance known as the Confederation of Free Cities. Each city-state brings its unique strengths to the alliance, whether it be military might, economic wealth, or magical prowess.

However, tensions simmer beneath the surface as rivalries and power struggles threaten to undermine the unity of the alliance. The city-states compete for dominance within the Confederation, vying for control over key resources, trade routes, and strategic territories.

Meanwhile, external pressures mount as neighbouring kingdoms seek to exploit divisions within the Confederation for their own gain. The player must navigate through the complex web of alliances, rivalries, and betrayals, making strategic decisions to ensure the survival and prosperity of their city-state within the ever-shifting political landscape of the alliance.
