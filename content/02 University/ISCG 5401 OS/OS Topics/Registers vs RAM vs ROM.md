# Registers:
Registers are neither *RAM* **(Random Access Memory)** or *ROM* **(Read-Only Memory)**. Registers are a distinct type of memory that is built directly into the *CPU* **(Central Processing Unit)** of a computer.

- Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the *CPU*.
- They are used to hold data temporarily during processing.
- Registers are the fastest type of memory in a computer system, offering extremely fast access times compared to *RAM* or *ROM*
- Registers are used for storing data operands, memory addresses, instruction pointers, and status flags during program execution.
- Registers are not accessible by programmers directly; they are managed by the *CPU* hardware itself.

# RAM (Random Access Memory):
*RAM* is a type of volatile memory used to store data and program instructions that are actively being used or processed by the *CPU*.
- *RAM* is external to the *CPU* and is typically located on separate memory modules storage (eg. hard drives), but is slower than registers.
- *RAM* is temporary memory, meaning its contents are lost when the computer is powered off or restarted.

# ROM (Read-Only Memory):
*ROM* is a type of non-volatile memory used to store firmware and essential system instructions that do not change over time.
- *ROM* is also external to the *CPU* and is typically located on a chip on the motherboard or on other peripheral devices.
- *ROM* retains its contents even when the computer is powered off.
- *ROM* contains firmware such as the *BIOS* **(Basic Input/Output System)** or *UEFI* **(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**, which are used to boot and initialise the computer's hardware.
- *ROM* is typically measured in hundreds of *Gigabytes* **(GB)** or in some cases even *Terabytes* **(TB)**
