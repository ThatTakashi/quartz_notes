# Process and CPU Scheduling:
## Running processes in an OS:
- In a **multi-tasking OS**
	- **Multiple processes** can run at the same time
- **Resource issues**
	- How is the CPU utilised?
		- Most personal computers(PC's) and handheld devices are controlled by **one CPU**
		- Some servers have **multiple CPU's** however we still need to think about how to **manage** the workload.

## CPU Utilisation:
- Process execution consists of a cycle of **CPU execution** and **I/O waiting**
	- This process is called, **CPU-I/O Burst cycle**
		- An I/O bound program has a short CPU burst
		- A CPU bound program has a long CPU burst
	- Eventually the final CPU burst ends with a sys request to terminate execution
