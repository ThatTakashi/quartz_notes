[[RAM Identification]]
# What is memory?:
Internal storage areas in the computer

# Volatile/Non-Volatile:
**Volatile** - data/information that is lost when the power is turned off
**Non-Volatile** - data/information is retained when the power is turned off

# Random/Sequential Access:
**Random Access** - data/information can be accessed in any order
**Sequential Access** - data/information must be accessed in sequential order

# Two Types of Memory:
### Random Access Memory(RAM)
- Random access
- Volatile
- Read and Write to RAM

### Read Only Rom(ROM)
- Random access
- Non-Volatile
- Read and Write to ROM

# Features of RAM:
- **Speed**
- **Price** - 

# Two Types of RAM:
- **SDRAM** - Synchronous dynamic random access memory
	- SIMMs (Single inline memory module)
		- 30 pin SIMM
		- 70 pin SIMM
	- DIMMs (Dual inline memory module)
		- 168 pin DIMM
		- 184 pin DIMM
		- 240 pin DIMM
		- 284*/288 pin DIMM
- **DRAM** - Dynamic random access memory
- **SRAM** - Static random access memory
	- Cache
	- Registers

# SRAM
- 4-6 Transistors are used to represent each bit

### SRAM Characteristics:
- Special high speed memory (buffer (holding area))
- Faster than DRAM
- More expensive to buy me MB
- Used in CPU registers and cache
- Does not need to be refreshed
- Only used in relatively small amounts
- Desired amount of cache depends totally on software used, and individual user requirements

# Cache:
- **Cache** is not so much a type of memory but a use of memory to speed up access to data

### Cache Packaging:
- **Hardware Cache**
	- Uses special memory chips to hold data
	- Built right into the hardware

# SDR vs DDR:
**SDR** - 1 transfer per clock cycle

**DDR** - 2 transfers per clock cycle
- Doubles the amount of mega transfers per second of **SDR** despite having the same clock speed

GDDR5 - traditional GPU with memory chips around the GPU
HBM - layers memory chip
