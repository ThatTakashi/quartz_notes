# BUS
A collection of wires/tracks that transfer data or power between computer components, typically controlled by a device driver software
- Internal
- External
- Computer to Computer
Every component in a computer connects to a BUS. Even components such as VDU or printers connect to a computer to a BUS in some way.

## BUS Characteristics:
- Clock Speed
	- Number of times a bit is sent along the BUS measures how quickly bits move along the BUS
- Width
	- Number of data bits that can be sent along the BUS at once (i.e. 8, 16, 32, 64bits)
- Bus Performance
	- **Bus throughput**:
		- Number of bytes of data that can be transferred via the BUS in one second
	- **BUS throughput calculations**:
		- BUS clock speed * BUS width = BUS throughput
- Control signals
	- Which component the data is for
	- Where blocks of data start and end
	- Any other information related to the...
- Logical and Physical connections
	- **Logical connection**:
		- One-to-many
	- **Physical connections**:
		- Each BUS defines its set of connectors to physically plug devices, cards or cables together
- Internal and External

200MHz x 64b x 2 = 25600mbps
