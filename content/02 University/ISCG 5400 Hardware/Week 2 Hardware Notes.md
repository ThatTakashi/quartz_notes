# How do we measure the speed of a CPU
### Hertz (Hz)
1 Hz = 1 Cycle
1 KHz = 1,000 Hz
1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz
1 GHz = 1,000,000,000 Hz

# Multithreading
Able to run for example, multiple tabs in google chrome rather than having to open a new chrome window for every site you want to have open at the same time.
