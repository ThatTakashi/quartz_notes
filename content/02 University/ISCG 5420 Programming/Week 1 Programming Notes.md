# History of Programming:
### 1883:
The first computer program is thought by historians, to have been written by **Ada Lovelace**. This program was written on a primitive mechanical computer named the **Analytical Engine**. Lovelace found that numbers could represent more than just the numerical values of things.

### 1950s:
The first actual programming language, **Fortran** is created. This language was mainly used in the fields of science and engineering.

### 1960s:
More general programming languages such as COBOL *(Common Business Oriented Language)* and BASIC *(Beginners all-purpose Symbolic Instruction code)* are developed in the 1960s. Some of these languages such as BASIC were what were used to program consumer personal computers such as the **Commodore 64**.

### 1970s:
Languages such as C and Pascal are developed which were used to develop operating systems and applications. For the time, C was in a league of its own in terms of performance.

### 1980s:
The first object oriented language named **Smalltalk** was developed. Being object oriented allowed developers to create reusable chunks of code that could greatly optimize programs.

### 1990s:
The first scripting languages **Python** and **Perl** were developed. These languages were useful for web development.

### 2000s:
Languages such as **Ruby** and **PHP** become popular for web development. PHP allows for easy access to backend material and is what is used to run many popular forum/message board software

# Types of Programming Languages:
### Low Level Languages:
These languages are closer to raw machine code, they are able to interface more efficiently with the hardware within the computer. They are however more complex to learn and write with some low level languages requiring the management of components such as memory, etc.
#### Machine Language:
Machine language is the lowest level programming language that a computer can understand. Machine language is entirely made up of 1s and 0s representing the binary value of each address in memory.

### High Level Languages:
High level languages are easier to learn than low level languages due to them having a more human readable syntax. These languages however do not boast the efficiency that low level languages do and are slower to compile.

> [!info] Conversion
> Code written in high level languages such as Python will get converted at runtime into machine code by a compiler. This process is automatic and is the reason that Python and other high level languages can be slower than low level languages.

### Scripting Languages:
These languages are used to automate repetitive tasks. Python, Perl and Ruby are all scripting languages for example.
